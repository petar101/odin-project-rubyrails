Assignment
We’ll be creating a one-way flight booker. You’ll get lots of practice populating and building dropdown menus, radio buttons, and nested submissions. Let the fun begin!

This project will require you to seed your database, so use your db/seeds.rb file to write the code necessary to populate Airports and Flights. One trick for toy apps like this (don’t do it for production!) is to use the db:seed:replant task for simultaneously clearing the database and running your seeds file. That way, when you create a new model or change how you want your sample data set up, you can just update the seeds.rb file and run $ rake db:seed:replant to have a clean slate of data.
